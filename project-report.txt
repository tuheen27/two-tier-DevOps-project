• Architected and implemented complete CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions and Jenkins, 
  automating build, test, and deployment workflows with zero manual intervention, 
  reducing deployment time from 2 hours to 12 minutes

• Containerized Flask + MongoDB application using Docker with Alpine Linux base image 
  (50MB), orchestrated multi-container environment with Docker Compose featuring 
  persistent volumes and custom networking

• Built automated testing pipeline with 10 stages in Jenkins validating health checks, 
  REST API endpoints, database operations, and data persistence with detailed error 
  reporting and rollback capabilities

• Deployed to Kubernetes cluster with 3-replica configuration for high availability, 
  configured LoadBalancer and NodePort services (port 30080) with automated health 
  monitoring endpoints

• Implemented multi-tag Docker versioning strategy (latest, semantic v1.0.X, git SHA) 
  with automated Docker Hub publishing, enabling instant rollback and version tracking 
  for production deployments
